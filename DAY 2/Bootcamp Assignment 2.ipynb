    "Barua is standing at x = 0 facing the positive x-axis. He loves watching stars but is too lazy to move or even turn around at that matter. For the same reason he can see the stars located in the first quadrant but cannot see the ones located in the second quadrant (because he doesn't have eyes on his back). You are given the co-ordinates of N stars and you need to tell him the fraction of the total stars that he will be able to observe.<br>\n",
